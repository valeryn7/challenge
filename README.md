React(^latest) and react-dom(^latest): The choice of the React framework was influenced by my previous experience with it. Additionally, it stands out for its proficiency in creating user interfaces and its strong community.

Bootstrap(^5.3.2) and reactstrap(^9.2.0): I had previously worked with these libraries, and they come with pre-designed components that are easy to use.

Sass(^1.68.0) and node-sass(^9.0.0): You can divide CSS into SCSS modules, which makes it clearer when you are using it, and it also includes variables and allows selector nesting.

Typescript(^5.2.2): Enables you to reduce errors and increase security by providing static types to the code. It enhances code quality and stability.

Prettier(^3.0.3): Within the dev dependencies, it helps to maintain the desired code formatting for the application.

EsLint(^8.50.0): Configured for error detection and includes rules for adhering to code standardization.
